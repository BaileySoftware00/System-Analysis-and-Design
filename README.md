#DriverPass Project
The driver pass project was a project that simulated developing a development plan for a contracting company. I was a member of the companies that had to develop the UML diagrams, product breakdown, and timeline for development. 

#What I did well
I think I broke down the customer's desires well and understood what they wanted out of the product. I suggested ideas that they hadn't thought of to help improve their product while still maintaining their vision for this service. 

#What I would revise and improve
I would revise and improve my UML class diagram. It was hard for me to visualize the class diagram without actually breaking down how I would code this software in my mind. I would want to review and remake the UML diagram so that it would be a better reflection of the product. 

#How I interpreted the user's needs and desires
The user wanted a product that had the ability to help people pass their driving test. They wanted this product to have autonomy where drivers and users could work together to schedule drive time. It was imperative to the company that their product was user-friendly;y and easily accessible. They are important factors to consider when designing a product because the goal is to make a product that you are proud of as the designer but that the customer is happy with. 

#How do I approach design software
My approach to designing software is to break down each aspect of the final product that the customer wants. If they want to have drivers and users work together to schedule drive time then I think how best to implement that desire. Having an updatable vector that stores the available times would be my approach for that particular problem. Breaking this down for each aspect of the product allows me to envision how to write the software and its various classes.
